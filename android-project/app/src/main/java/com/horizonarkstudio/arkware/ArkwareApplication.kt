/**
 * Enables Material You dynamic color (wallpaper-derived theming) on
 * Android 12+ (API 31+) devices, app-wide, and owns process-wide
 * startup that has to happen before any Activity or background
 * Worker might run -- most importantly [ArkLogger.init], since
 * [NotificationSyncWorker] can execute via WorkManager on its own
 * schedule even if the user never opens MainActivity in a given
 * process lifetime, and its failures still need to reach the
 * on-device failure log.
 *
 * [DynamicColors.applyToActivitiesIfAvailable] is a no-op below API
 * 31, so this is safe across this app's full minSdk range -- devices
 * that can't do dynamic color just keep the branded fallback palette
 * defined in themes.xml / values-night/themes.xml. In practice this
 * only affects the splash background and system bars, since the
 * WebView content itself is youtube.com's own theming, not this
 * app's.
