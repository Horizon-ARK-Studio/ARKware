/**
 * Strips any SurfaceView inside a view tree of the z-order flags that
 * let it paint above the rest of the window (Chromium's fullscreen
 * customView is backed by a hardware-composited SurfaceView with
 * setZOrderOnTop/setZOrderMediaOverlay commonly left on, which would
 * otherwise sit in front of native overlays like the stretch-to-fill
 * button regardless of normal View add-order).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: must only run its setters once per fullscreen session --
 * see [neutralize]'s own doc for why re-invoking on an
 * already-neutralized, actively-rendering Surface causes fullscreen
 * video to pause/resume in a loop.
