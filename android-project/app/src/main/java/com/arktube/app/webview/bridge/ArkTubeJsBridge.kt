/**
 * Common base for every `@JavascriptInterface`-annotated bridge class
 * exposed to page JS (ThemeBridge, OrientationBridge,
 * MediaPlaybackBridge).
 *
 * WebView invokes these methods on its own JS thread, not the UI
 * thread -- and, critically, an uncaught exception thrown from a
 * `@JavascriptInterface` method doesn't surface the way a normal
 * crash would; it can silently abort that one bridge call. [safeCall]
 * is what gives every bridge method uniform try/catch/finally
 * logging, so a failure inside a bridge shows up in Logcat and the
 * on-device failure log instead of just quietly not doing anything.
 * Subclasses stay one-liners: wrap the body in `safeCall("methodName") { ... }`.
