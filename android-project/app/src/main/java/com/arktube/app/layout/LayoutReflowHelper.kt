/**
 * Forces YouTube's own page JS to re-sync off-screen list items (most
 * visibly the "Up next"/related-videos row) to the WebView's real
 * width after a rotation -- Chromium's own layout reflows correctly
 * on its own, but page JS listening specifically for `resize`/
 * `orientationchange` DOM events doesn't reliably get told to
 * re-measure just because the WebView's own View was resized by the
 * framework. See the two-part fix in [reflow]: synthetic DOM events,
 * plus a 1px scroll nudge (the same trigger manual scrolling causes).
 *
 * Retried at a few short delays since rotation/inset settling and the
 * WebView's own internal resize don't all necessarily land in the
 * same frame.
